# MedicalEditor-backend

- It's the backend for my graduate project, which is a editor. But I think It's an amazing project because it's especially designed for dockor.
- We have countless functions, such as edit like Microsoft Words, different modes, design/write seperated, continued-priting, remaining-changes and so on...
- If you like this project, DON'T wait to use it. It's a free project.
